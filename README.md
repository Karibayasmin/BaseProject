# 🧱 Android Base Project Template

This repository was created as a **starter boilerplate for Android projects**, intended to contain commonly used **fundamentals**, **best practices**, and **reusable architecture components**.

The goal is to **save time and ensure consistency** across future Android projects by having a reliable and well-structured base to build from.

---

### 🎯 Objective

- Avoid rewriting the same setup code for every new Android project  
- Standardize architecture and structure  
- Include out-of-the-box support for dependency injection, networking, and UI patterns  
- Improve project scalability and maintainability  

---

### 📦 Planned Features

Although the project is still in early development, the following were intended to be included:

- 📐 **Architecture**: MVVM / Clean Architecture structure  
- ⚙️ **Dependency Injection**: Dagger or Hilt  
- 🌐 **Networking**: Retrofit + OkHttp  
- 🧪 **Unit Testing**: JUnit, Mockito  
- 🧩 **Jetpack Components**: ViewModel, LiveData, Navigation Component  
- 🎨 **UI Layer**: Modular design, reusable components  
- 🛠️ **Utility Classes**: Resource wrappers, BaseViewModel, extension functions  
- 📋 **Project Configuration**: Gradle conventions, build flavors, CI support

---

### 🛠️ Tech Stack (Planned)

- **Language**: Kotlin   
- **Libraries**: Retrofit, Coroutine, Dagger/Hilt, Room, Jetpack Compose 
- **Testing**: JUnit, Espresso, MockK

### ⏳ Current Status

> 🧪 The project is in its initial phase and currently under development.  
I haven’t been able to commit time to it recently, but I plan to gradually evolve this into a production-ready Android base template.
